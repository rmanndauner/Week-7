    <h1> Meet Douglas! </h1>

    <p>Hi! I'm Douglas, I was found in Douglas Country, which is how I got my name. I am a tripod kitty, when I was little, some mean person threw me out of a car as a <strong>KITTEN</strong>. Some nice people found me and helped heal my body. That's how Mom and Dad found me. I am the most reclusive of my siblings, but just as loving. I may only have three legs, but I am more agile than my sisters when it comes to jumping and wiggling under covers to sleep. If you can't find me, look for lumps under covers. </p>
